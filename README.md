### Read the Bitcoin Core RPC API documentation directly from IntelliJ IDEA

This project is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that provides access to the Bitcoin Core RPC API documentation directly from the IDE. The main functionality includes:
1. Selection of the Bitcoin Core version for viewing the documentation.
2. Viewing the list of available RPC API methods for the selected version.
3. Viewing detailed information about the selected method, including description, response schema, and usage examples.

The plugin is installed through IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
2. Click `Install Plugin from Disk`.
3. Find and select the plugin file with the `.jar` or `.zip` extension.
4. Click `OK` and restart IntelliJ IDEA.

Please note that you will need internet access for the plugin to work, as it loads the documentation directly from the Bitcoin Core website.

The plugin is available for download from the [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23574-bitcoindocs/) or from the [Releases](https://github.com/ZooMMaX/BitcoinDocs/releases/tag/1.0) section of this repository.
